    "text": "I am an Engineer turned Data Analyst. I believe that technical rigor without curiosity is just calculation, not insight.\n\nThe “Plot Twist” (My Background)\nI didn’t start in a computer science lab; I started in the labs of ESIQIE - IPN, graduating as a Petroleum Chemical Engineer.\nThere, I forged a steel-trap mind for Mathematics (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability) and Process Optimization. My first lines of code weren’t in Python, but in Fortran and Matlab, solving thermodynamic equations.\nThis background gave me a unique perspective: I see data analysis not just as “coding,” but as optimizing a system. I transitioned to Data Science because I realized the same logic used to refine chemical processes could be used to refine business decisions.\n\n\nMy Superpower: The Researcher’s Mindset\nI pride myself on being a lifelong learner. While my core strength is mathematical logic, my “superpower” is my research capability.\nI don’t just rely on what I already know; I possess the discipline to study, read, and master new tools on the fly. Whether it’s deep-diving into a new R library or understanding a complex business requirement, I have the grit to find the answer and the technical foundation to implement it correctly.\n\n\nBeyond the Data\nWhen I step away from the screen, I blend my analytical side with leadership and creativity:\n\n🏀 Leadership: As a former basketball team captain for “Club Deportivo Leones,” I learned that strategy is useless without team execution.\n🎥 Creative Tech: I explore the intersection of technology and art. I am a hobbyist photographer, and I actively experiment with AI Media Generation to support audiovisual projects.\n🎬 Cinema & Storytelling: I am a huge fan of music and streaming series. This isn’t just entertainment; it fuels my appreciation for narrative structure.\n\n\n\nLet’s Connect\nI am based in Mexico City and always open to discussing data strategy, optimization challenges, or just sharing a good series recommendation.\nFeel free to reach out via LinkedIn or Email."
