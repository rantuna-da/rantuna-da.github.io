I am an Engineer turned Data Analyst. I believe that technical rigor without curiosity is just calculation, not insight.

### The "Plot Twist" (My Background)

I didn't start in a computer science lab; I started in the labs of **ESIQIE - IPN**, graduating as a **Petroleum Chemical Engineer**.

There, I forged a steel-trap mind for **Mathematics** (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability) and **Process Optimization**. My first lines of code weren't in Python, but in **Fortran** and **Matlab**, solving thermodynamic equations.

This background gave me a unique perspective: I see data not just as numbers, but as a system to be optimized. I channeled this engineering mindset into **Data Analytics** to solve complex business problems. Currently, I am expanding my toolkit into **Data Science**, applying advanced statistical models to go beyond explaining *what* happened and start predicting *what's next*.

### My Superpower: The Researcher's Mindset

I pride myself on being a lifelong learner. While my core strength is mathematical logic, my "superpower" is my **research capability**.

I don't just rely on what I already know; I possess the discipline to study, read, and master new tools on the fly. Whether it's deep-diving into a new R library or understanding a complex business requirement, I have the grit to find the answer and the technical foundation to implement it correctly.

### Continuous Learning & Certifications

To solidify my transition and keep my skills sharp, I have completed specialized training programs:

-   **Data Science with R** (by Duke University on Coursera)
-   **Google Data Analytics** (by Google on Coursera)

### Beyond the Data

When I step away from the screen, I blend my analytical side with leadership and creativity:

-   **🏀 Leadership:** As a former basketball team captain for "Club Deportivo Leones," I learned that strategy is useless without team execution.
-   **🎥 Creative Tech:** I actively experiment with photography, video, and *AI Media Generation*. Exploring these tools keeps me on the bleeding edge of how technology is transforming content creation.
-   **🎬 Cinema & Storytelling:** I am a huge fan of music and streaming series. This isn't just entertainment; it fuels my appreciation for *narrative structure*.

### Let's Connect

I am based in **Mexico City** and always open to discussing data strategy, optimization challenges, or just sharing a good series recommendation.
