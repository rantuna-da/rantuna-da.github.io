title: "About"
---

I am an Engineer turned Data Analyst. I believe that technical rigor without curiosity is just calculation, not insight.

### The "Plot Twist" (My Background)

I didn't start in a computer science lab; I started in the labs of **ESIQIE - IPN**, graduating as a **Petroleum Chemical Engineer**.

There, I forged a steel-trap mind for **Mathematics** (Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability) and **Process Optimization**. My first lines of code weren't in Python, but in **Fortran** and **Matlab**, solving thermodynamic equations.

This background gave me a unique perspective: I see data analysis not just as "coding," but as **optimizing a system**. I transitioned to Data Science because I realized the same logic used to refine chemical processes could be used to refine business decisions.

### My Superpower: The Researcher's Mindset

I pride myself on being a lifelong learner. While my core strength is mathematical logic, my "superpower" is my **research capability**.

I don't just rely on what I already know; I possess the discipline to study, read, and master new tools on the fly. Whether it's deep-diving into a new R library or understanding a complex business requirement, I have the grit to find the answer and the technical foundation to implement it correctly.

### Beyond the Data

When I step away from the screen, I blend my analytical side with leadership and creativity:

-   **🏀 Leadership:** As a former basketball team captain for "Club Deportivo Leones," I learned that strategy is useless without team execution.
-   **🎥 Creative Tech:** I explore the intersection of technology and art. I am a hobbyist photographer, and I actively experiment with **AI Media Generation** to support audiovisual projects.
-   **🎬 Cinema & Storytelling:** I am a huge fan of music and streaming series. This isn't just entertainment; it fuels my appreciation for **narrative structure**.

### Let's Connect

I am based in **Mexico City** and always open to discussing data strategy, optimization challenges, or just sharing a good series recommendation.
